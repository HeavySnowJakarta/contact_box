# How Contact Attributive Protocal works

This guide explains how CAP profiles work with this project. To learn how to write CAP profiles to extend the app, see [the part of extending](../extending/cap.md).

[lib/rustcore/src/cap](../../../lib/rustcore/src/cap/mod.rs) are the codes about organizing the CAP profiles. See [README.txt of that directory](../../../lib/rustcore/src/cap/README.txt) for the full structure of the directory.
