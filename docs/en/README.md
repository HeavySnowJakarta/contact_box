# Contact Box

Contact Box is the next app to manage all your contacts. Instead of let them be messful on the Contacts app or scatterd on different social media apps, now you can manage them together within one app and avoid losing anyone. What's more, Contact Box has the following features:

+ **Powerfully extendable**: Telephone number, address, birthday, and ANY kind of social media--and jump to the related page at once with only a tap.
+ **Format friendly**: Easy to import from and export to different file formats: VCD, CSV, Excel... Want to add all the dates to the Calendar? just use your favorite tool to deal with the data file!
+ **Cross-platform sync**: Keep your contacts synchronous between your phones and computers. Written with Flutter, it's not really hard to port the app to your preferd operating system.

## Building

## About other parts of the project

Now the project is not completed at all. Once I get free I will make all files organized and write the documents about the details.
